<h2 align="left"><u>What is Wildlife?</u></h2>
<div id="info">
<p>Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.<br>
Wildlife was also synonymous to game: those birds and mammals that were hunted for sport. 
Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems.<br>Deserts, plains, grasslands, woodlands, forests, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife.<br>
While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife<br>
is affected by human activities.Some wildlife threaten
human safety, health, property, and quality of life.<br>However, 
many wild animals, even the dangerous ones, have value to human beings.<br>
This value might be economic, educational, or emotional in nature.</p><br>
