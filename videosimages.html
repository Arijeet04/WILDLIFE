    <h3>Red Panda</h3>

        The red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also known as the lesser panda, is a small mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. 
        It has dense reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs, white-lined ears, a mostly white muzzle and a ringed tail. 
        Its head-to-body length is 51–63.5 cm (20.1–25.0 in) with a 28–48.5 cm (11.0–19.1 in) tail, and it weighs between 3.2 and 15 kg (7.1 and 33.1 lb). 
        It is well adapted to climbing due to its flexible joints and curved semi-retractile claws.
        The red panda was first formally described in 1825. The two currently recognised subspecies, 
        the Himalayan and the Chinese red panda, genetically diverged about 250,000 years ago. 
        The red panda's place on the evolutionary tree has been debated, but modern genetic evidence places it in close affinity with raccoons, weasels, and skunks.
        It is not closely related to the giant panda, which is a bear, though both possess elongated wrist bones or "false thumbs" used for grasping bamboo. 
        The evolutionary lineage of the red panda (Ailuridae) stretches back around 25 to 18 million years ago, as indicated by extinct fossil relatives found in Eurasia and North America.

            The kākāpō (/ˈkɑːkəpoʊ/ KAH-kə-poh;[3] Māori: [kaːkaːpɔː];from the Māori: kākāpō, lit. 'night parrot'), 
            also known as owl parrot (Strigops habroptilus), is a species of large, flightless, nocturnal, 
            ground-dwelling parrots of the super-family Strigopoidea, endemic to New Zealand.
            The kākāpō is critically-endangered; the total known adult population is 252 living individuals, 
            all of which are named and tagged, confined to four small islands off the coast of New Zealand that have been cleared of predators.
            The past introduction of predators such as cats, rats, ferrets, and stoats during British colonisation almost wiped out the already-rare kākāpō, having suffered over-hunting from the early Māori. 
            Conservation efforts began in the 1890s, but they were not very successful until the implementation of the Kakapo Recovery Programme a century later in 1995.

            The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear (or simply the panda), is a bear species endemic to China.
            It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, 
            a neighboring musteloid.The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, and also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.
            As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived,and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.

    <h3>Wolf</h3>

            The wolf (Canis lupus;[b] pl: wolves), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. 
            More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves, as popularly understood, comprise wild subspecies. 
            The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae. It is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle. 
            The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. 
            The banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.
